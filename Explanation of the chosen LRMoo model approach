During the study of conceptual models, we noticed that LRMoo offers two possible approaches or perspectives to follow when mapping data.

Approach 1


F1 Work — R80 Performed (performed in) — F31 Performance


This relation is based on the property R80 Performed (performed in), which links the ideas contained in an intellectual or artistic creation with the act of performing those ideas. In our view, this goes against the analytical focus promoted by these conceptual models, reducing the semantic value that can potentially be assigned to cultural heritage.
Studies on the meaning of “Work” in different conceptual models (FRBRoo, LRMoo…) initially support the logic of a possible relation between “Work” and “Performance.” However, they also state that “Work cannot be created without an Expression and a Manifestation.” This raises the question: how can “Performance” be directly related to “Work” without passing through Expression and Manifestation? Furthermore, in performing arts, “Performance” and “Manifestation” may even be equivalent. If these conceptual models are to be a reference for all heritage, including “ephemeral” arts, such issues should be reconsidered.


Approach 2


F1 Work — R40 is realised in (realised) — F2 Expression — R4 embodied (is embodied in) — F3 Manifestation — R7 exemplifies (is exemplified by) — F5 Item


The second approach is based on the use of the WEMI classes, which are the core of the model and the foundation for ontologies built upon it.
For instance, in a dance work (F1 Work), roles such as choreographer or music composer are linked to intellectual creation, while performers like dancers or musicians are connected to the realisation of the expression (F2 Expression). This distinction follows the definitions of F1 Work as the conceptual idea of the work, and F2 Expression as a more concrete but immaterial realisation of that idea.
Thus, F1 Work encompasses the fundamental ideas of a piece (what the choreographer and composer intend to convey), while F2 Expression represents the point when those ideas are transmitted to specific performers, who create a particular version of the work. Different groups of performers yield different F2 Expressions of the same F1 Work.
Each instance of F2 Expression, when performed, gives rise to one or more F3 Manifestations (one per performance session), understood as unique and ephemeral representations characteristic of intangible cultural heritage. F5 Items, in turn, represent the documentary records of the work.
F3 Manifestation and F5 Item are the most problematic classes, as their definitions are oriented towards bibliographic records, mainly referring to text publications (F3) and copies of those publications (F5). Nonetheless, their definitions can be adapted to the performing arts domain, offering a broader perspective that should be more explicitly reflected in their official formulation.
This distinction between Work, Expression, Manifestation, and Item is the foundation of our proposal. Around it, the rest of the classes and properties orbit. To describe other information found in the archive that is linked in various ways to the WEMI classes, we reused classes and properties from LRMoo and CIDOC CRM. For aspects not directly covered by the model, other vocabularies are used.
The result is a differentiated perspective from existing proposals, one that better represents performing arts heritage. Its main objective is to establish an axiomatisation —that is, our interpretation of the WEMI classes within this domain— that is flexible but free of contradictions.
